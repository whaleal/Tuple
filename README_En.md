# Intro

 

This is a Java that focuses on tuple operation separated from icefrog project

Tuple is a data structure that can store multiple elements, and the data type of each element can be different.

Tuple is similar to list collection, but the difference is that list collection can only store one data type, while tuple can store multiple data types. 
When tuple is created, it can directly specify multiple element data types.

Tuple is a basic concept in relational database. Relationship is a table. Each row in the table (each record in the database) is a tuple and each column is an attribute. 
In a two-dimensional table, tuples are also called rows.



# Why use it

For example, if you need to return multiple values, we use java, usually define a Model class, or simply put it directly in MAP,
These two ways are actually not very convenient, one requires frequent definitions, and the other for the type of return value we don't know.

TUPLE in Java supports us to create ten return values, where the types in Tuple, we can store it casually.
Here is actually used in java, to help us express the type inside.


### üêûProvide BUG feedback or suggestions

Submit Problem Feedback Please indicate the JDK version, TUPLE version and related dependency library version.

- [github issue](https://github.com/whaleal/tuple/issues)

### üß¨Share the steps to share the code
1. Find questions that need to be repaired on GitHub Issues, or to contribute to characteristics
2. In GitHub or Github on the Fork project to your own REPO
3. Putting Fork past items is your project clone to your local
4. Modify the code and perform related tests
5. COMMIT after Push to your own library 
6. Log in GitHub or Github You can see a Pull Request button in your homepage, click on it, select your own dev branch and the DEV branch of this item, fill in some explanations, and then submit it.
7. Waiting for the maintainer merger

### üìêPrinciple of PR

Tuple welcomes anyone to contribute code for Tuple, and the PR (PULL Request) that needs to be submit is in line with some specification, the specification is as follows:

1. Completion, especially each new method, according to the Java document specification, the method, parameter description, return value description, etc., if necessary, add a unit test, if you want, you can also add your name.
2. The indentation of TUPLE is indent according to the IdeA default (Tab).
3. The new approach does not use a third-party library method, TUPLE follows an unregistered principle (unless the method tool is added in the EXTRA module).
4. Please Pull Request to `V1-Dev` branch. TUPLE uses a new branch after the 1.x version: `v1-main` is the main branch, indicating that the version has been released, this branch does not allow PR, nor allows modification.
